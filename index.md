### Project overview
The project for the semester is going to be a calculator application created using the Python programming language. The app will have features of that of a regular calculator like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. In addition, the app will also perform trigonometry and convert unit measurements.

The overall project will be conducted in two phases: The first phase includes testing of the functionalities. The app will be completed in the console without a graphical interface. After successful completion of Phase 1, Phase 2 will focus on creating the graphical interface using Python's Tkinter library.

For the software development model, the project will follow a prototype model, releasing iterations in which each version of the application has improved functionality and/or design.
