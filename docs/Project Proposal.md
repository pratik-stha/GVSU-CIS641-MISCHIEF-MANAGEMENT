# Introduction
The project for the semester is going to be a Calculator application created using Python programming language. The app will have features of that of a regular calculator like regular addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. In addition, the app will also have the feature to convert units.

The overall project is planned to be conducted in two phases. First phase includes testing of the functionalities. The app will be completed in console without Graphical Interface. After successful completion of phase one, phase two will be done which is to create the graphical interface using Tkinter library. 

For the software development model, Prototype model is going to be used. Various version is going to be released with some improvements than previous versions making the application better and advanced. 


# Anticipated Technologies

Various technologies will be used for the project. As mentioned earlier, Python programming language is the major tool that will be used in this project. Anaconda package will be used for this. Talking about the Graphical Interface, Tkinter is going to be used which is a graphical library for python. The whole application will be programmed using VS Code Editor and Jupyter depending on the situation. 

# Method/Approach
The application is planned to be created in two different phases. First phase includes development of application in console environment without graphical interface. This is done to check the functionality of the application. Various functionalities include regular addition, subtraction, multiplication and division and also unit conversions. After successful completion of phase one, phase two will be done which includes the development of graphical user interface. 

Prototype model will be implemented for the project. The basic idea in Prototype model is that instead of freezing the requirements before a design or coding can proceed, a throwaway prototype is built to understand the requirements. This prototype is developed based on the currently known requirements. The project will be started by releasing a base version. Then in every cycle an improvement will be done to the project and a new version will be released. The advantages of this model include detection of error, easy addition of new features and functions, ideas get clearer as new versions are released. Fig 1 depicts the process of the prototype model that will be followed by the project.
