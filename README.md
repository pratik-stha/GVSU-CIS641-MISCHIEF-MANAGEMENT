# Mischief Management

We will be creating a calculator app that does common mathematical functions and unit conversions. We plan on creating the app first in Python and then, in the second phase, adding the graphic interface using tkinter. This is so we can confirm the functionality first before we focus on the visual design. 

## Team Members and Roles

* [Pratik Shrestha](https://github.com/pratik-stha/CIS641-HW2-Shrestha.git) (Engineer, Designer, Documentation)
* [Vivi Hoang](https://github.com/vivi-hoang/CIS641-HW2-Hoang) (Designer, Tester, Documentation)

## Prerequisites

## Run Instructions

The project is done in Python 3.7. Thus Python 3.7 has to be installed on the target machine. The project folder consists of several projects files: The file "Calculator.py" contains the main function. The project can be executed from any program that can execute Python. 

### Running from Windows Command Line

* Check if Python 3.7 is installed on the machine.
* If not, Python 3.7 needs to be installed first.
* From command line, locate the file directory in which the project is stored.
* Type "python Calculator.py" in the command line to execute the application.
* The calculator application will run.
* To close the app, hit the close button ("X") in the top right-hand corner.

### Running from Visual Studio Code

* Check if Python 3.7 is installed on the machine.
* If not, Python 3.7 needs to be installed first.
* The Python environment also needs to be installed in VS Code.
* Open the project directory.
* Open the file "Calculator.py" and click Run and Debug (F5) in the left pane or simply press Run Code (Ctrl+Alt+N).
* Select the python debug configuration if you are using a debugger (Run and Debug).
* This will run the application
* To close the app, hit the close button ("X") in the top right-hand corner.
