# Mischief Management

We will be creating a calculator app that does common mathematical functions and unit conversions. We plan on creating the app first in Python and then, in the second phase, adding the graphic interface using tkinter. This is so we can confirm the functionality first before we focus on the visual design. 

## Team Members and Roles

* [Pratik Shrestha](https://github.com/pratik-stha/CIS641-HW2-Shrestha.git) (Role 1, Role 2)
* [Vivi Hoang](https://github.com/vivi-hoang/CIS641-HW2-Hoang) (Role 3, Role 4)

## Prerequisites

## Run Instructions

The project is done in Python 3.7. Thus python 3.7 has to be installed in the target machine. The project folder consists of several projects files. The file "Calculator.py" is the file which contains the main function. The project can be execute from any program that can execute python program. 

### Running from Windows Command Line

* Check if Python 3.7 is installed in the machine
* If not Python 3.7 needs to be installed first
* Locate the file directory from command line where the project is stored
* Type python calculator.py in command line to execute the application
* The calculator application will run
* To close the app, simply hit the close button on the top right


### Running from Visual Studio Code

* Check if Python 3.7 is installed in the machine 
* If not Python 3.7 needs to be installed first
* Python environment also needs to be installed in VS Code
* Open the project directory
* Open the file calculator.py and click Run and Debug (F5) on left pane OR simply press Run Code (Ctrl+Alt+N)
* Select the python debug configuration if you are 
* This will run the application
* To close the app, simply hit the close button on the top right
